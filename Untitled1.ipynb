Анализ частоты вычислительных ошибок Приведенный ниже код используется для анализа уровня ошибок (ELA) изображений в контексте задачи классификации изображений животных.

Функция compute_ela_cv() принимает путь к изображению и параметр качества, сжимает изображение с использованием сжатия JPEG с заданным качеством и вычисляет абсолютную разницу между сжатым и исходным изображениями. Разница умножается на масштабный коэффициент и возвращается в виде изображения ELA.

Функция convert_to_ela_image() принимает путь к изображению и параметр качества, сжимает изображение с использованием сжатия JPEG с заданным качеством, вычисляет абсолютную разницу между сжатым и исходным изображениями и возвращает изображение ELA. Изображение ELA вычисляется с использованием разницы в значениях пикселей между исходным и сжатым изображениями и нормализуется для усиления различий.

Функция random_sample() принимает путь к каталогу и необязательное расширение файла и возвращает случайный путь к файлу из этого каталога с указанным расширением (если указано).

Наконец, код генерирует набор изображений ELA, используя функцию compute_ela_cv() для случайно выбранного изображения из тестового набора данных изображений животных. Изображения ELA генерируются с понижающимся уровнем качества, что приводит к повышению уровня сжатия и, следовательно, к увеличению уровня ошибок. Результирующие изображения отображаются с использованием matplotlib.

В целом, этот код предоставляет способ визуального анализа влияния различных уровней сжатия JPEG на изображения животных и может быть использован для определения оптимальных уровней качества для сжатия изображений в контексте задачи классификации изображений животных.

Предварительная обработка данных.

Данные будут разделены на три различные категории: Обучение, валидация и тестирование. Данные обучения будут использоваться для обучения модели CNN глубокого обучения, и ее параметры будут точно настроены с учетом данных валидации. Наконец, производительность данных будет оценена с использованием тестовых данных (данных, которые модель ранее не видела).


# Разделять данные о тренировках и тестах
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(image_df, test_size=0.2, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
     

train_generator = ImageDataGenerator(
    preprocessing_function=tf.keras.applications.efficientnet.preprocess_input,
    validation_split=0.2
)

test_generator = ImageDataGenerator(
    preprocessing_function=tf.keras.applications.efficientnet.preprocess_input,

Обучение модели Изображения модели будут обработаны предварительно обученной моделью CNN под названием Efficient Net B 0. Для мониторинга обучения будут использоваться три обратных вызова. Это: Контрольная точка модели, ранняя остановка, обратный вызов Tensorboard. Краткое описание гиперпараметра модели показано следующим образом: Batch size: 32 Epochs: 25 Input Shape: (224, 224, 3) Output layer: 525
